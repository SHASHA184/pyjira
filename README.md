# Task Tracker API

This is a task management API built using **FastAPI**. It allows users to create, retrieve, update, and delete tasks, with support for multiple assignees, role-based access control (RBAC), and email notifications when task statuses change.

## Features
- **User Roles**: Admin, Manager, and User.
- **Task Management**: Create, retrieve, update, and delete tasks.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Different access levels based on roles.
- **Email Notifications**: Sends email updates when task statuses change.

## Tech Stack
- **FastAPI**: A modern, fast web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+.
- **SQLAlchemy**: SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library.
- **Celery**: Distributed task queue for background job processing.
- **Pydantic**: Data validation and parsing using Python type annotations.
- **Alembic**: Database migrations tool for SQLAlchemy.

Gmail Users: Setup for Email Notifications
If you want to use Gmail for sending email notifications, follow these steps:

Visit [Google Account Security Settings](https://myaccount.google.com/security) and enable 2-Step Verification.
Under 2-Step Verification, go to App Passwords and generate a new password for your app.
Use the generated 16-character password in the ```.env``` file as the ```MAIL_PASSWORD```.

### 3. Build Docker containers
To build and run the Docker containers:
```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

### 4. Run database migrations
To apply the initial database migrations:
```bash
docker-compose exec app alembic upgrade head
```

## Usage
### Access the API documentation
Once the server is running, you can access the API documentation via Swagger UI:
- Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

This interactive documentation allows you to test all API endpoints.

### User Authentication

1. Create a new user account by hitting the ```/users``` endpoint.
2. Log in using the ```/login``` endpoint and get an authorization token.
3. Use the **Authorize** button in the Swagger UI to pass the token for making authenticated requests.
